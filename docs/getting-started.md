# Getting started

Running the Eligibility Server application in a local, non-production environment requires [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

## Running the app locally for development

The following commands should be run in a terminal program like `bash`.

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cal-itp/eligibility-server.git
cd eligibility-server
```

### Create an environment file

Use the sample as the template.

```bash
cp .env.sample .env
```

The .env file specifies the following value:

- `ELIGIBILITY_SERVER_SETTINGS`: Path to a [Python configuration file](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/config/#configuring-from-python-files) which will override default settings

See [Configuration](../configuration) for more details on supported settings.

### Build image using Docker Compose

```bash
docker compose build --no-cache server
```

### Start the server

```bash
docker compose up [-d] server
```

The optional `-d` flag will start in detatched mode and allow you to continue using the terminal session. Otherwise your terminal will be attached to the containerâ€™s terminal, showing the startup and runtime output.

After initialization, the server is running on `http://localhost` at a port dynamically assigned by Docker. See [Docker dynamic ports](https://docs.calitp.org/benefits/getting-started/docker-dynamic-ports/) for more information on accessing the site on localhost.

### Run healthcheck

To check if the server is running successfully, use your browser to get to the Healthcheck endpoint: `http://localhost:50252/healthcheck`

The page should read "Healthy"

### Stop the server

```bash
docker compose down
```

## Develop with VS Code Remote Containers

This repository comes with a [VS Code Remote Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) configuration file.

Once you clone the repository locally, open it within VS Code, which will prompt you to re-open the repository within the Remote Container.

1. Build and Open the Dev Container
2. Start the `eligibility-server` Flask app and database with `F5`
3. Now you can run tests from the container.

Starting the Dev Container will run `bin/init.sh`, which runs a command to initialize the database. More specifically, it creates the database and imports and saves users based on the configured settings.

## Run tests

### Run unit tests

Unit tests are implemented with [`pytest`](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/) and can be found in the [`tests/`](https://github.com/cal-itp/eligibility-server/tree/dev/tests) directory in the repository. `pytest` is installed and available to run directly in the devcontainer.

The test suite runs against every pull request via a GitHub Action.

### Destroy and recreate database

In testing the database, you may need to teardown the database and restart a database from scratch.

The command below will remove all users and drop the database:

```bash
flask drop-db
```

To set up the database with a new import file or other configuration variables, after making any new environment variable changes, run:

```bash
flask init-db
```

## Run and develop the Documentation

These docs are built and published with GitHub Actions.

To run the docs locally:

```bash
docker compose up docs
```

Read more on how to run the docs [here](https://docs.calitp.org/benefits/getting-started/documentation/).
