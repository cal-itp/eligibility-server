        ## Prepare a new release

        Use the form below to prepare a new release of eligibility-server.

        Each release is coordinated by a **Release Manager**. The release manager may assign sub-tasks or ask for help
        as-needed, but is otherwise responsible for all aspects of the release.

        Each release also identifies a **Smoke Tester** responsible for carrying out Smoke Tests.

        After this issue is created, use the checklist to manage the steps
        of the release process, marking items as completed. [Read more about the
        release process](https://docs.calitp.org/eligibility-server/releases/).

        Close this issue when the checklist is complete.
